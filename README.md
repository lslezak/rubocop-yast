This is a plugin for [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
a Ruby static code analyzer.

It was inspired by [Rubocop-Rspec](https://github.com/nevir/rubocop-rspec)
and [YCP Zombie Killer](https://github.com/yast/zombie-killer).

The goal is to create a Rubocop plugin which can check for
[YaST](http://yast.github.io/) specific issues. Optionally it should allow to
covert some ugly code parts introduced by the automatic code conversion done by
[YCP Killer](https://github.com/yast/ycp-killer) (conversion from YCP to Ruby).

*The plugin is currently in early development, always manually check the chages
done by the plugin! It can eat your code... ;-)*
